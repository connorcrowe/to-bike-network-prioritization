# Product Approach: 🚲📍 Bicycle Infrastructure Network Expansion Prioritization
###### to-bike-network-prioritization

This project builds a tool to help city planners and residents identify the highest-impact locations for new bike lanes in Toronto. Leverages ridership-data, spatial analysis, and predictive modelling.

>‎ 
>Alongside the final product, **this repo will demonstrate a full  product development lifecycle** — framing the problem, validating assumptions, shaping solutions, building the MVP, and launching with metrics.
>‎ 

## Product Development Cycle & Repo Structure
The project will be done similar to the [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) framework by Basecamp, adapted for a solo project. This framework aims to scope work without being either too abstract or concrete and ship a measurable MVP before investing further.

| Phase | Objectives |
|-------|------------|
| [`/scoping`](./scoping) | Define initial problem space, list assumptions, inventory available data, and run experiments to validate or invalidate hypotheses. |
| [`/shaping`](./shaping) | Explore solution options, map them in an opportunity-solution tree, and scope an MVP plus a next version. | 
| [`/building`](./building) | Build the MVP: process data, train models, design web map. Document decisions. |
| [`/launch`](./launch) | Publish product, measure against problem, reflect, and define next steps. |

**While the project is under development**, the *current phase's version of the **product brief*** will serve as the README below.
- *Each phase includes a product brief. During development, the current phase’s brief serves as the repo README to show how the product evolves through its lifecycle.*

## Status: *Scoping*
- **06.05:** Framed initial problem statements, assumptions and user groups.

## Product Brief: Toronto Bike Network Prioritization
###### Phase: Scoping

### Problem Statements
***Drafts**. Suspicions based on initial data, to be modified post-experimentation.*
1. Members of the public cannot easily see where new bike infrastructure would be most impactful
2. Expansion planning may not prioritize segments with the greatest latent demand
3. Without costly individual studies, it is unclear to planners where bike lanes would have the most impact
4. There is no transparent, data-driven way for residents/advocates to propose or compare new bike lanes
5. Current infrastructure underserves equity-deserving communities

### Assumptions
1. Members of the public care about this prioritization.
2. Planners & advocates lack data-driven, network-level insights to help them prioritize.
3. Existing planning and prioritization is overlooking certain insights
4. Infrastructure or prioritization is unequitable.

### User Groups
*What are the user personas? How severely are they impacted by each problem statement?*
### Data Inventory
- Roadway & Bike Lane Network - *Open Street Map*
- Bikeshare Ridership - *Toronto Open Data*
- ***Needed**: Feature data (population density, transit stops, destinations, etc.)*

### Experiments
- Interview advocacy groups.
- Interview planners (if possible),
- Analyze current ridership patterns, see if existing network and next planned lanes match up with high usage roads.
- Analyze current network reach vs equity factors.

### Conclusions
*Finalize problem statements here*
