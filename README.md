# Product Approach: 🚲📍 Bicycle Infrastructure Network Expansion Prioritization
###### to-bike-network-prioritization

This project builds a tool to help city planners and residents identify the highest-impact locations for new bike lanes in Toronto. Leverages ridership-data, spatial analysis, and predictive modelling.

>‎ 
>Alongside the final product, **this repo will demonstrate a full  product development lifecycle** — framing the problem, validating assumptions, shaping solutions, building the MVP, and launching with metrics.
>‎ 

## Product Development Cycle & Repo Structure
The project will be done similar to the [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) framework by Basecamp, adapted for a solo project. This framework aims to scope work without being either too abstract or concrete and ship a measurable MVP before investing further.

| Phase | Objectives |
|-------|------------|
| [`/scoping`](./scoping) | Define initial problem space, list assumptions, inventory available data, and run experiments to validate or invalidate hypotheses. |
| [`/shaping`](./shaping) | Explore solution options, map them in an opportunity-solution tree, and scope an MVP plus a next version. | 
| [`/building`](./building) | Build the MVP: process data, train models, design web map. Document decisions. |
| [`/launch`](./launch) | Publish product, measure against problem, reflect, and define next steps. |

**While the project is under development**, the *current phase's version of the **product brief*** will serve as the README below.
- *Each phase includes a product brief. During development, the current phase’s brief serves as the repo README to show how the product evolves through its lifecycle.*

## Status: *Scoping*
- **06.05:** Framed initial problem statements, assumptions and user groups.

## Product Brief: Toronto Bike Network Prioritization
###### Phase: Scoping

### Problem Statements
***Drafts**. Suspicions based on initial data, to be modified post-experimentation.*
| User      | Theme      | Problem Statement |
| -         | -          | -                 |
| Planners  | Insight    |  Planners lack network-wide tools and integrated data sources to identify high-impact opportunities, relying on slow, road-by-road studies. |
| Advocates | Insight    |  Advocates lack access to transparent, shared data to effectively push for or compare new bike lane proposals. |
|           |            | |
| Residents | Visibility |  Residents have no easy way to understand where new bike lanes would have the greatest impact. |
| Residents | Visibility |  The criteria driving infrastructure decisions are opaque. |
|           |            | | 
| Planners  | Equity     |  Planners don’t have integrated tools to identify and prioritize infrastructure gaps in equity-deserving neighborhoods. |
| Residents | Equity     |  Equity-deserving communities are under-served by prioritization of new infrastructure. |

### Assumptions
**Insight**
- Planners currently rely on fragmented, manual methods for identifying new bike lane opportunities.
- Planners do not have a reliable, integrated view of demand indicators like ridership, land use, or network gaps.
- Planners would use a more data-driven network-level tool if it fit into their workflow.
- Advocates would trust and adopt a shared data platform to support proposals if it were credible and accessible.

**Visibility**
- Residents want more insight into how infrastructure decisions are made.
- Residents don’t currently trust that bike lanes are added based on need.
- Residents would engage with a tool that shows demand and prioritization clearly, if it were simple and visual.

**Equity**
- Planners want to incorporate equity but don’t have the means to do it well.
- Equity-deserving residents feel underserved, and their experiences are not regularly gathered or included in prioritization.

### User Groups
**Planners**
- **Role**: Evaluate and prioritize bike infrastructure improvements, or studies for improvements
- **Constraints**: Budget, policy
- **Assumed Needs**: Defensible, data-backed prioritization workflow

**Advocates**
- **Role**: Represent community needs, push city to act faster for better infrastructure
- **Constraints**: Volunteerism, lack of access to officials and city resources
- **Assumed Needs**: Publicly available data for impact comparison

**Residents**
- **Role**: End users; voters; feedback providers, advocates; often unaware of decision process nuance
- **Constraints**: Highly local perspective; limited time, trust
- **Assumed Needs**: Visibility and/or influence on city priorities

### Data Inventory
- Roadway & Bike Lane Network - *Open Street Map*
- Bikeshare Ridership - *Toronto Open Data*
- ***Needed**: Feature data (population density, transit stops, destinations, etc.)*

### Experiments
- TBD

### Conclusion: Finalized Problem Statements
*Finalize problem statements here*
