## Product Brief: Toronto Bike Network Prioritization
###### Phase: Scoping

### Problem Statements
***Drafts**. Suspicions based on initial data, to be modified post-experimentation.*
1. Members of the public cannot easily see where new bike infrastructure would be most impactful
2. Expansion planning may not prioritize segments with the greatest latent demand
3. Without costly individual studies, it is unclear to planners where bike lanes would have the most impact
4. There is no transparent, data-driven way for residents/advocates to propose or compare new bike lanes
5. Current infrastructure underserves equity-deserving communities

### Assumptions
1. Members of the public care about this prioritization.
2. Planners & advocates lack data-driven, network-level insights to help them prioritize.
3. Existing planning and prioritization is overlooking certain insights
4. Infrastructure or prioritization is unequitable.

### User Groups
*What are the user personas? How severely are they impacted by each problem statement?*
### Data Inventory
- Roadway & Bike Lane Network - *Open Street Map*
- Bikeshare Ridership - *Toronto Open Data*
- ***Needed**: Feature data (population density, transit stops, destinations, etc.)*

### Experiments
- Interview advocacy groups.
- Interview planners (if possible),
- Analyze current ridership patterns, see if existing network and next planned lanes match up with high usage roads.
- Analyze current network reach vs equity factors.

### Conclusions
*Finalize problem statements here*
