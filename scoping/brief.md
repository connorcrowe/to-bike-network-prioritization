| User      | Theme      | Problem Statement |
| -         | -          | -                 |
| Planners  | Insight    |  Planners lack network-wide tools and integrated data sources to identify high-impact opportunities, relying on slow, road-by-road studies. |
| Advocates | Insight    |  Advocates lack access to transparent, shared data to effectively push for or compare new bike lane proposals. |
|           |            | |
| Residents | Visibility |  Residents have no easy way to understand where new bike lanes would have the greatest impact. |
| Residents | Visibility |  The criteria driving infrastructure decisions are opaque. |
|           |            | | 
| Planners  | Equity     |  Planners don’t have integrated tools to identify and prioritize infrastructure gaps in equity-deserving neighborhoods. |
| Residents | Equity     |  Equity-deserving communities are under-served by prioritization of new infrastructure. |

### Assumptions
**Insight**
- Planners currently rely on fragmented, manual methods for identifying new bike lane opportunities.
- Planners do not have a reliable, integrated view of demand indicators like ridership, land use, or network gaps.
- Planners would use a more data-driven network-level tool if it fit into their workflow.
- Advocates would trust and adopt a shared data platform to support proposals if it were credible and accessible.

**Visibility**
- Residents want more insight into how infrastructure decisions are made.
- Residents don’t currently trust that bike lanes are added based on need.
- Residents would engage with a tool that shows demand and prioritization clearly, if it were simple and visual.

**Equity**
- Planners want to incorporate equity but don’t have the means to do it well.
- Equity-deserving residents feel underserved, and their experiences are not regularly gathered or included in prioritization.

### User Groups
**Planners**
- **Role**: Evaluate and prioritize bike infrastructure improvements, or studies for improvements
- **Constraints**: Budget, policy
- **Assumed Needs**: Defensible, data-backed prioritization workflow

**Advocates**
- **Role**: Represent community needs, push city to act faster for better infrastructure
- **Constraints**: Volunteerism, lack of access to officials and city resources
- **Assumed Needs**: Publicly available data for impact comparison

**Residents**
- **Role**: End users; voters; feedback providers, advocates; often unaware of decision process nuance
- **Constraints**: Highly local perspective; limited time, trust
- **Assumed Needs**: Visibility and/or influence on city priorities
